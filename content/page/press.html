        <span class="h2-introduction">City of Zion is an opensource community. However, our brand is precious to us. We like it! That's why we have a press area with a couple of HQ and Vector logo's for you to use. These logo's are free to use for promoting, advertorials, tutorials, banners and explanations. We do ask you to use the color schematics we have used below. This way we ensure our brand is used the way we thought of it!.</span>
