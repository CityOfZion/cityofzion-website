        <span class="h2-introduction">City of Zion is an opensource community. However, our brand is precious to us. We like it! That's why we have a press area with a couple of HQ and Vector logo's for you to use. These logo's are free to use for promoting, advertorials, tutorials, banners and explanations. We have a couple of rules to which you obey when downloading and using one of these logo's.</span>
